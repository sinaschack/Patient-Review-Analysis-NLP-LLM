        "# Advanced LLM-Driven Topic Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Overview**\n",
        "Building on the initial BERTopic analysis, this phase demonstrates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated topic extraction and summarization of patient feedback. Instead of unsupervised clustering alone, Falcon-7B-Instruct is leveraged to generate precise, human-readable topics from textual reviews, providing a complementary, AI-driven perspective on negative patient experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Differences from BERTopic Approach**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLM vs. traditional topic modelling:** While BERTopic clusters reviews based on semantic embeddings, Falcon-7B-Instruct directly interprets text to extract the top themes per review.\n",
        "* **Structured summarization:** LLM output allows generation of concise, normalized topic labels across reviews, improving readability and actionable insights.\n",
        "* **Scalability:** Falcon-7B enables processing of large datasets in parallel using GPU acceleration, supporting rapid insights for enterprise-scale applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Selection & Cleaning**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Focused on negative reviews (<3 stars) from Google and Trustpilot datasets.\n",
        "   * Preprocessed text: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Language Filtering**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Applied `langdetect` to ensure only English reviews were analyzed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **LLM Topic Extraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Loaded Falcon-7B-Instruct via Hugging Face Transformers.\n",
        "   * Generated top 3 topics per review using an instruction-based text generation pipeline.\n",
        "   * Normalized topics into consistent categories (e.g., \u201cWaiting Times,\u201d \u201cStaff Behavior,\u201d \u201cTreatment Quality\u201d).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Aggregation & Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Counted overall frequency of each topic across hospitals.\n",
        "   * Identified recurring issues and location-specific pain points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Skills Demonstrated**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Applying LLMs for structured information extraction from unstructured text.\n",
        "* GPU-accelerated NLP processing and memory optimization.\n",
        "* Combining traditional and advanced NLP methods for richer insights.\n",
        "* Translating raw textual data into actionable business intelligence for healthcare operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Outcome**\n",
        "This approach provides a human-interpretable, AI-enhanced view of patient feedback, complementing traditional topic modeling. Hospitals and healthcare managers can quickly understand critical pain points and prioritize interventions, demonstrating how LLMs can augment standard NLP pipelines for practical, decision-making insights.\n"
